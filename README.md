This is a final project for Intro to Mechatronics. The goal of the final project is to build a functioning robot that is able to first navigate to the initial firing zone with avoiding physical obstacles, then after arriving to the firing locating an enemy beacon land two shots at the enemy robot. The beacon's signal will be masked by the obstacles emitting different frequencies.
